This is an analysis on a data from the accelerometer from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site were the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This R script mainly focus on cleaning dataset and proceeds as following: 

1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The features selected are stored in dataset called ‘feature_selected’;

2. Extracted only the data of selected features from the training and testing dataset to two new dataset: test_x, test_y;

3. Combined the information for variables, subjects, and activities together for both training and test data, called ’train’ and ‘test’

4. Combined the training set and testing set together into one dataset, called total_set. 

5. Calculated the mean of each activity for the combination of each subject and each acidity and save the result to a tidy dataset, called ‘average_table’.
